# thor - the text edithor
This is a hobby project, nothing serious 

## Compile and install

to compile just run `make`

to install run `sudo make clean install`


## FEATURES

### vim-like gestures (the one I use):
* edit mode and insert mode
* create and edit the line under with o
* create and edit the line over with O
* yanking with yy (also works with multiple lines - y5y)
* pasting with p
* deleting with d also works with multiple lines - d5d)
* searching with / (while writing use arrows to scroll words)
* going to the start of the file with g
* going to the end of the file with G
* deleting current char with x
* delete char before with X

### features with `:`:
* :help to ask for salvation
* :w to save (wow)
* :q to quit (crazy hard)
* :q! to quit without saving (!)
* :wq to save and quit?!?!?! (amazing)
* :num where num is a number, to go to that line

### base highlighting for:
* C (also cpp...)
* shell
* text files
* more on the way... sometime in the future
